## Introduction

This data analysis done for CLIM 680 studies the relationship between precipitation over India and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. I chose this topic to solidify the research theory that PDO and the Indian monsoon are inversely related.


## Data

The datasets I used are:

Indian Precipitation Data
Found in NetCDF format  on the COLA servers. This precipitation data was collected by Dr.Jagadish Shukla and his research assistants. It is observed monthly mean precipitation data over India from 1901 to 2019 in units mm/day.

Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index Data
Found at https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/ . This dataset is an idex of PDO calculated from monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Northern Pacific Ocean from 1948 to 2018.

## Conda Environment

The environment needed to run this code is found on the environment.yml file.

## Codes, Analyses, and Results

The notebook including the code for all of my analyses can be found here https://github.com/swhitak9/CLIM680DataProject/blob/master/Whitaker680Project.ipynb

### Indian Climate

India is a relatively dry country except during monsoon season (June-September).

### Indian Monsoon

According to the precipitation data, India experienced a very wet monsoon during the year of 1988 and a very dry monsoon during the year of 1911.

### Composites

Composites show that warm PDO phases tend to render drier conditions in India while cool PDO phases tend to render wetter conditions in India.
Compositses show a statistical significance in Northern India in both Warm PDO-Neutral PDO and Cool PDO-Neutral PDO differences.

### Correlation between PDO and India Precipitation Anomalies

Data analysis suggests a weak correlation between PDO and precipitation anomalies with a slight positive correlation in the northern and eastern regions.

### Correlation between PDO and 1988 Indian Monsoon Precipitaion

Data analysis seems to suggest a strong correlation between PDO and 1988 Indian monsoon precipitation in Eastern India and along the west coast, which is where the highest precipitation values are observed during the monsoon of 1988.

## Summary

In this data analysis I studied India's precipitation climatology, monsoon precipitation, and the relationship between India's precipitation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

I discovered that India is a generally dry region that receives most of its precipitation during the monsoon season. According to the precipitation data, India experienced a a very wet monsoon during the year of 1988 and a very dry monsoon during the year of 1911.

My analysis pointed to a relationship between Indian precipitation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Warm PDO phases tended to bring overall drier conditions to the country and cool PDO phases tended to bring overall wetter conditions to the country, although there was much variability depending on regions within the country.

Composite differences in both the Warm PDO-Neutral PDO and Cool PDO-Neutral PDO showed significance in Northern India.

Correlation between PDO and Indian precipitation anomalies seemed to be quite weak with small positive correlation values in Northern and Eastern India.

Correlation between PDO and the 1988 Indian monsoon seemed to be highly correlated in Eastern India in addition to along the Western Coast. These are areas in which the highest precipition values were observed during the 1988 monsoon. Although this seems to be a telling result, it must be remembered that correlation does not equal causation. PDO was in a warm phase during 1988 which, if one recalls, is theorized to bring drier conditions, not wetter.

Further examination using the given data would be needed in order to correctly theorize the relationship between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Indian monsoon.
